# Stop Signal Task (SST) Template Repository

This repository contains all necessary resources for setting up and running the **Stop Signal Task (SST)** ‚Äî a well-established paradigm in cognitive neuroscience for studying **response inhibition and cognitive control**.

> üîó **GitHub Repository:** [Merluin/Psychopy_SST_template](https://github.com/Merluin/Psychopy_SST_template)

---

## Overview

This template includes:

- ‚úÖ A **PsychoPy3 implementation** of the SST
- ‚úÖ An **R program** to compute **Stop Signal Reaction Time (SSRT)**  
  following the standardized procedures outlined in [Verbruggen et al., 2019](#references)

---

## Repository Structure

- **PsychoPy3 SST Task**  
  `.psyexp` and supporting files for running the experiment in PsychoPy

- **R Program for SSRT**  
  Scripts to preprocess data and compute SSRT metrics

---

## Task Design

The SST consists of:

- **Go trials**: Respond as fast as possible to a green arrow indicating direction.
- **Stop trials**: Inhibit your response if a stop signal (e.g., `"XX"`) appears after a short delay.

The **Stop Signal Delay (SSD)** is dynamically adjusted based on the participant's performance to estimate the **Stop Signal Reaction Time (SSRT)**.

---

## Task Parameters

| Parameter   | Value / Description             |
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |
| Initial SSD | 150 ms after go signal onset    |
| SSD Range   | 50 ms to 650 ms                 |
| Go Stimulus | Green arrow (left or right)     |
| Stop Signal | `"XX"` shown after variable SSD |

## Requirements

### PsychoPy Task

- PsychoPy version `2022.1.4` or later

### R Scripts

- Latest version of R (tested on 4.x)
- Optionally: RStudio for better usability

---

## Installation

### 1. Run the PsychoPy Task

- Install [PsychoPy](https://www.psychopy.org/download.html)
- Clone or download the repository
- Open `SST.psyexp` in PsychoPy
- Run the task

### 2. Analyze Data in R

- Install R from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org)
- Open the R script(s) in the `R Program for SSRT` folder
- Follow in-script comments to:
  - Import task data
  - Clean responses
  - Compute SSRT

---

## Customization

- **In PsychoPy**:

  - Modify trial durations and timing
  - Change response keys or stop signal format

- **In R**:
  - Adapt input format for your data
  - Extend analyses (e.g., condition-level SSRT, visualizations)
