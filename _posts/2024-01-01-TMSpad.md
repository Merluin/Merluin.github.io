# TMS TouchPad P4R4

{% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/pad.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}

Welcome to the **TMS-TouchPad-P4R4** repository ‚Äî an open-source interface developed to enhance and simplify **Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)** sessions in neuroscience research.

> üîó GitHub Repository: [Merluin/TMS-TouchPad-P4R4](https://github.com/Merluin/TMS-TouchPad-P4R4)

This tool combines an **Arduino-based control system** with a **Python GUI running on a Raspberry Pi**, providing a modular and user-friendly solution for interacting with TMS hardware and EEG/EMG recording systems.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety and Disclaimer

> **This is a work-in-progress research tool**.  
> The authors **assume no responsibility** for damage, injury, or misuse of the hardware or software.  
> Use is strictly limited to individuals trained and competent in the handling of **TMS and EEG/EMG systems**.

## Open to Collaboration

We welcome collaboration with:

- Researchers using TMS or EMG/EEG setups
- Developers interested in expanding the GUI or microcontroller features
- Labs aiming to integrate automated stimulation protocols (e.g., ccPAS)

Please reach out if you‚Äôd like to contribute, provide feedback, or test the system.

## Overview

The **TMS-TouchPad-P4R4** enables **precise control** over TMS stimulation parameters using a graphical interface and real-time communication with an Arduino-compatible board.

It is compatible with:

- TMS devices receiving TTL input via BNC
- EEG/EMG systems logging event markers
- Protocols such as **ccPAS**

## Key Features

- **Arduino Integration**  
  Low-level control of TMS triggers and BNC output via `R4_ppTMS.ino`

- **Python GUI for Raspberry Pi**  
  Intuitive interface to adjust delay times, TTL duration, and trigger sequences

- **EEG/EMG Compatibility**  
  Outputs clean TTL pulses aligned with stimulation events

- **Dual Serial Communication**  
  Uses both `Serial` (USB) and `Serial1` (TX/RX) for flexible setup
