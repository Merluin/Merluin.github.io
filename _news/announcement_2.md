As of September 1st, 2024, I have officially begun a new postdoctoral research position at the **Department of Psychology, University of Bologna**, under the supervision of **Dr. Sara Borgomaneri**.

This position follows the successful outcome of the public selection held on **June 7, 2024**, for one research fellowship titled:

> _“Uncovering the Neural Basis of Authentic Emotion Recognition”_

The project is funded by the European Union – **NextGenerationEU**, under the Italian **National Recovery and Resilience Plan (PNRR)** – Mission 4: Education and Research, Component 2: From Research to Enterprise – Investment 1.1, as part of the **PRIN 2022 PNRR** call (Ministerial Decree No. 1409 of 14/09/2022).

Project title:  
**_How we perceive emotions' authenticity: neural basis and rehabilitation pathways_**  
Project code: **MUR P2022LC5AK_002**  
CUP: **J53D23017250001**

The selection results were formally approved on **July 22, 2024** (D.D. n. Rep. 197 Prot. 2004), officially appointing **Dr. Thomas Charles Joseph Quettier** as the awardee.

I'm thrilled to join this project and contribute to advancing our understanding of how the brain processes the authenticity of emotional expressions, with implications for both basic neuroscience and rehabilitation strategies.
