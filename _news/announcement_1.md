Today, **September 22, 2025**, I am joining the **General Strike** called by the Unione Sindacale di Base (USB).  
I am suspending all my work activities for the entire day and taking part in the related demonstrations.

Although my current position as a postdoctoral researcher does not formally grant me the right to strike, I have chosen to stop working today **for a research that serves the freedom of peoples, not their oppressors**.

I strike to express my **solidarity with the Palestinian people**, who are enduring an ongoing genocide, and to demand a **free Palestine**.

> Our country and our universities are complicit in Israeli policies: I demand an immediate change of course.
>
> What is happening in Gaza is **not in my name**.
