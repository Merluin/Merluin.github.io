ðŸ“… **Save the date!**  
The next edition of my **ARCA Workshop â€“ PsychoPy3: Programmare un esperimento** will begin on **November 27, 2025**.

ðŸ§  Hosted by the **Department of Developmental Psychology and Socialisation**, University of Padua, this hands-on course (20 hours) will guide participants through the design and implementation of cognitive experiments using **PsychoPy**â€™s Builder interface.

ðŸ’» No prior coding experience is required â€” the workshop is open to students and researchers interested in developing their own experimental protocols in psychology, neuroscience, and beyond.

ðŸ“œ Participants will receive an **Open Badge** upon completion.

More details and registration info will be available soon.
