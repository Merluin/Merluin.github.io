I am a cognitive neuroscientist and registered clinical psychologist whose career bridges social work, clinical practice, and neuroscience research. Before entering academia, I worked in frontline services with individuals facing severe mental health challenges, addiction, and social exclusion.

My research lies at the intersection of sensorimotor neuroscience, social cognition, and neuromodulation, with a focus on facial motor control and emotion recognition.

I currently develop paradigms that combine tactile mechanoreceptor stimulation, TMS, and behavioral methods, primarily using custom PsychoPy components. I am committed to open science and regularly share tools and code to promote transparency and collaboration.
